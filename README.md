* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

-	The Snowflake idea began when one of the founders “Benoit Dageville” was given the opportunity by an investor to architect a data warehousing in the cloud from scratch. Benoit realized that he was not going to be able to do it by himself, and that was when he brought Thierry Cruanes into the picture to help him architect the idea. They quit their jobs and decided to buy a printer and a whiteboard and started working out of Benoit’s apartment. What Benoit and Thierry wanted to do was to build a system that would adapt the resources that were used based on the demand, so customers would only pay for what they use, and that was how they built a cloud data platform from scratch that changed how data is stored and analyzed today.

-	Snowflake has the capability to offer multiple features that their competitor do not offer such as time travel, zero copy cloning, native machine learning, automatic query catching, multi cloud but their most unique feature is that automatically optimizes queries to ensure fast query performances, and that customer’s pay only for what they use. The unfair advantage is that business can build resources dynamically because of snowflake elasticity and storage

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

-	Snowflake has helped businesses to reduce their query times from hours to seconds, and has helped businesses of all sizes reduce expending in storage. In addition, snowflake allows business to share large data with external partners which has led to data driven decision making.



* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

-	Some of the core metrics that companies utilize in cloud computing to measure success are availability, reliability, scalability, security, efficiency, and application performance and ease of use

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

-	Google Biquery is renowned for the performance on large dataset which often outshines competitors. I would recommend snowflake to expand on its large dataset

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

-	Snowflake would benefit from having large dataset given that when the warehouse is performing other queries, snowflake cannot start incoming queries until adequate resources are free

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

-	Apache Hadoop is one of the best technology product to handle big data

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

-	I think that having Apache Hadoop since is one the best product to handle big data would resolve the company issue of incoming queries for big dataset
